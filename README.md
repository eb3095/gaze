# gaze
Gaze is a chrome extension capable of analyzing a reddit user's history and displaying an analysis of who they are as a person.

# Goal
The principle is simple. Metrics, history, and NLP used together with Personality Templates will paint a solid picture of a persons
ideals, beliefs, politics, and personality. The intention is to make the internet more honest and eliminate gaslighting and misrepresenatation.

The underlying motivation is to deanonymize who people are as a person but not the person themselves. Limit peoples ability to lie
without exposing people to real world harm.

# Dependencies
- emotional_alert
- sentiment

# Note
This is not motivated by any ideology, politics, or agenda. This is being designed to unmask peoples heart's without unmasking their
face. Everyone should use it, regardless of their reason. Shedding light on the digital world's denizens can only improve it and them.
